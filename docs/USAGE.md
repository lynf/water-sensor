Two files are included in the /docs directory, sensor.hex and sensor.lst. The first file is the uTile UF0 application program executable image that may be written back to the uTile UF0 program storage in RAM. Once the program is in RAM, it can be stored permanently in EEPROM storage and autostarted each time the uTile is powered up.

The second file, sensor.lst, is a listing of the UF0 program instructions for the sensor management control program. The timer settings are shown at the end of the listing.

Please refer to the uTile Manual for a full description of the uTile PLC.
